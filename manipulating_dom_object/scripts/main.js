// Creating an Element
// To create an HTML element we use tag name. Creating an HTML element using JavaScript is very simple and straight forward. We use the method document.createElement(). The method takes an HTML element tag name as a string parameter.

// // syntax
// document.createElement('tagname')

// Creating elements
// To create multiple elements we should use loop. Using loop we can create as many HTML elements as we want. After we create the element we can assign value to the different properties of the HTML object.

// Appending child to a parent element
// To see a created element on the HTML document we should append it to the parent as a child element. We can access the HTML document body using document.body. The document.body support the appendChild() method. See the example below.

// As we have see in the previous section there is a better way to eliminate all the inner HTML elements or the children of a parent element using the method innerHTML properties.
